        The Blue Lagoon is one of Iceland's most popular attractions, and it's is little wonder as to why. The beautiful milky-blue water is unlike anything else found on earth, and makes a stark contrast to the surrounding black lava field and its creeping grey moss. It sits at 39°C year-round, making it the perfect temperature for bathing. The lagoon is situated in southwest Iceland.

        Strokkur is the primary feature of the Haukadalur valley and the main reason why it is one of the most visited sites in the country. While Geysir will very occasionally still erupt to enormous heights, it is nowhere near reliable enough to justify the area’s popularity. Haukadalur valley, however, has many other features that make it worth a visit.

    <p class="info"><b>Scandinavian sailors discovered Iceland in the mid-ninth century, and the first settler recognized in the literary-historical tradition, Ingólfur Arnason, arrived in 874. The book of settlements, which contains information on four hundred settlers, was compiled in the twelfth century. The story set down there and repeated to this day is that a Norse Viking named Flóki sailed to Iceland, but spent so much energy hunting and fishing that he did not lay up hay for his livestock, which died in the winter, and had to return. He then gave the island its unpromising name. </b>
